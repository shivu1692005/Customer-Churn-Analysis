# Customer Churn Analysis (EDA) using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on customer churn data to understand the key factors that influence customer attrition. The analysis helps identify patterns and trends related to customer behavior.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze customer data to identify churn patterns  
- Understand the impact of demographics, services, and billing on churn  
- Provide insights to help improve customer retention  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related information such as demographics, services subscribed, billing details, and churn status.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Univariate analysis of key features  
- Bivariate analysis between churn and other variables  
- Visualization of churn distribution and influencing factors  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified factors strongly associated with customer churn  
- Observed churn trends across different customer segments  
- Highlighted service and billing features impacting churn  

## 📁 Files in Repository
- `TCA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing EDA and visualizations  
- `customer_churn.csv` – Dataset used for analysis  

## ✅ Conclusion
The EDA provides valuable insights into customer churn behavior and highlights important factors that businesses can focus on to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
